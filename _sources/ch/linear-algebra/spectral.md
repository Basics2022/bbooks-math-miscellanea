# Spectral decomposition

- **Introduction.** What's spectral (or eigenvalue) decomposition? Arbitrarieness. When is it possible? Special matrices. Properties and theorems (Cayley-Hamilton)

   $$\mathbf{A} \mathbf{u}_i = s_i \mathbf{u}_i$$

- **Generalized spectral decompositions.** Generalized spectral decomposition of first order systems; generalized spectral deocmposition of second order systems[^2nd-order-underdamped]

   $$\mathbf{A} \mathbf{u}_i = s_i \mathbf{B} \mathbf{u}_i$$
   
   $$\left[ s_i^2 \mathbf{M}  + s_i \mathbf{C} + \mathbf{K} \right] \mathbf{u}_i = \mathbf{0} \ .$$

- **Sensitivity of spectral decomposition.** ...

[^2nd-order-underdamped]: It's likely that mainly underdamped systems with simultaneously diagonalizable matrices will be treated, as this kind of systems often arises in structural dynamics of elastic structures with small structural damping.
