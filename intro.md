# (Not so) Mathematics Basics


This material is part of the [**basics-books project**](https://basics2022.github.io/bbooks). It is also available as a [.pdf document](_build/latex/book.pdf).

**Contents.**
- **Linear Algebra.** ..., matrix factorization,...; basics of lots of numerical methods; **Vector and Tensor Algebra** provides the mathematical framework for manipulating vectors and tensors, the mathematical objects meant to represent **absolute quantities** - invariant under coordinate transformations - fundamental in geometry and physics.
- **Multivariable Calculus** provides the tools for working with continuous functions of many variables; **Differential Geometry** studies smooth curves, surfaces, volumes (and manifolds in general), within the framework of a Riemann structure, providing a metric to define distances, angles, curvatures and other geometric properties; **Vector and Tensor Calculus** studies vector and tensor fields defined on a manifold, along with their differentiation and integration, and thus being essential for a mature approach to geometry and physics;

- **Functional analysis** and **Complex Calculus** (complex analysis, transforms,...)
- ODEs
- PDEs
- Calculus of Variations: theoretical background; Lagrange multiplier method for constraints; sensitivty; gradient-based methods,...
- Optimization
