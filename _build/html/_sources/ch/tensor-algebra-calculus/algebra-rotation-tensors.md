# Unitary and rotation tensors

Some notes in the introduction to classical mechanics: [Rotations: Tensor formalism for rotations](https://basics2022.github.io/bbooks-physics-mechanics/ch/kinematics-rotations-tensors.html).

**todo** Move the mathematical treatment here?

**todo** Discuss vector operations that are invariant under 3-dimensional rotation and other unitary tensor applications (i.e. reflections). These properties are useful to prove the general expression of [isotropic tensors](tensor:algebra:isotropic-tensors).
