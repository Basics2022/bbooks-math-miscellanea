# Fourier Transforms

Fourier transforms are linear transformations of functions usually relating a physical domain of time and/or space, with a domain of frequency and/or wave-vectors.

Fourier transforms can be useful in:
- highlighting the frequency content of functions
- solving problems: sometimes, it can be easier to transform a problem in frequency domain, solve it in frequency domain, and transform the solution back to the physical domain

[**Fourier series**](complex:fourier:series). Fourier series is defined for finite-domain or periodic, time-continuous functions, or - more generally - continuous functions in the physical domain.

[**Fourier transform**](complex:fourier:transform). Fourier transform is defined for infinite-domain non-periodic, time-continuous functions, or - more generally - continuous functions in the physical domain.

[**Relations between Fourier transforms and sampling**](complex:fourier:transforms). Fourier series, Fourier transform, discrete time Fourier transform and discrete Fourier transforms are presented, and their relations discussed. Fundamental results about **evenly-spaced sampling** seamlessly follows, as **Shannon-Nyquist theorem**, {prf:ref}`thm-shannon-nyquist`, shows.


```

Different Fourier transforms exist, depending if the original function is:
- time discrete/time continuous 
- periodic/non-periodic
